ENG2003 left a positive influence on me.

This is because I used to think I was a good communicator, but after completing this course, I noticed I need to work on several aspects of my communication.

This class did not go as planned, since I had anticipated us to learn to communicate with one another through speech. Since we were taught how to communicate through voice, writing, and other forms of communication, this was not the case.

Among the course content that I found useful were the characteristics of a good email, presentation, resume, and technical report. This is due to the fact that they are all quite valuable in some element of our daily life. A technical report, for example, will come in handy whenever we work on a specific engineering project, and composing a decent email will come in handy when interacting with our colleagues.

 The technical report was the topic that got me most interested. This is because writing and researching my term project 1 was a lot of pleasure for me. I was able to write a technical report that was very well written and well researched, on a subject that I was interested in. I hope to use this knowledge in my future career.

 I can readily explain complicated topics in a way that my peers can comprehend. Report writing, making a decent presentation, and communicating ideas in a variety of formats are just a few of the ways that communication has improved. Two communication skills that I still need to work on are presentation skills and general speaking ability. This is due to the fact that I regularly utilise placeholder words such as "uh" and "um" when speaking. One of the reasons I do this, I believe, is that I already know what I want to say and how to say it, but I frequently fumble over my words because I talk too rapidly.

 Because this course has improved my communication with a range of peers as well as my ability to work constructively as a team using the various types of communication we have learned in this course, my experience in this course will influence how I approach other engineering classes. It's vital to communicate with your peers/coworkers in engineering practise so that everyone is on the same page.

 There will be many gaps in your work if there is no communication, and you will end up performing a lot of things incorrectly that could have been avoided. In conclusion, this course has taught me that communication is the most vital component of engineering, and that without it, nothing would work out in life. -->
